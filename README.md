# Efficient-Processing-of-MRI-Data
This project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of MRI data processing by integrating advanced AI algorithms and EEG data. Through this approach, the project seeks to improve diagnostic capabilities by providing more accurate and reliable insights.

# Note- 
# Step 1: Generate Your Kaggle API Key
- Log in to your Kaggle account.
- Go to your profile (top right corner) and select Account.
     - In the API section, click Create New API Token. This will download a file named kaggle.json.

# Step 2: Upload the API Key to Colab
- Open your Colab notebook.

- Run the following code to upload your kaggle.json file:

      - from google.colab import files
      - files.upload()
  
# Step 3: Set Up the Kaggle API
- Move the kaggle.json file to the correct directory:
    - !mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
    - !cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/

- Set appropriate file permissions:
    - !chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
      
# Step 4: Import the Dataset
- You can now download any dataset from Kaggle using the following command:
- !kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-name>
- Replace <dataset-name> with the name of the dataset from the Kaggle URL.

# Step 5: Extract the Dataset
 - If the dataset is a ZIP file, extract it using:
   
- !unzip <dataset-name>.zip
Your dataset is now ready for use in your Colab notebook!
